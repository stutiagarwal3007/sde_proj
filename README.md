# Turn-Based Chess-Like Game

## Objective
Develop a turn-based chess-like game with a server-client architecture, utilizing WebSockets for real-time communication and a web-based user interface.

## Components

### 1. Server
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, Express, WebSocket
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Handle WebSocket connections.
  - Manage game state and player turns.
  - Broadcast game updates to clients.
  - Implement game logic (valid moves, check/checkmate conditions).

### 2. Client
- **Technology Stack**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React or plain JS)
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Establish WebSocket connection to the server.
  - Render the game board and pieces.
  - Handle user interactions (moving pieces, displaying messages).
  - Update the UI based on server messages.

### 3. Game Logic
- **Rules**: Define the rules of the game, such as valid moves for each piece.
- **State Management**: Maintain the current state of the game (board configuration, active player, etc.).

### 4. WebSocket Communication
- **Connection**: Establish a WebSocket connection between the client and server.
- **Message Types**:
  - `join`: Notify the server when a player joins.
  - `move`: Send a move command to the server.
  - `update`: Receive game state updates from the server.
  - `message`: Chat functionality for players.

### 5. User Interface
- **Game Board**: A grid layout representing the chessboard.
- **Pieces**: Interactive elements that can be dragged and dropped.
- **Notifications**: Display messages for player turns, errors, and game status.
